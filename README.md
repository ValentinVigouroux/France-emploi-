# Introduction
Used a Scrapy spider to extract hundreds of job postings from the France Travail website by keywords, region, and required experience, enabling more effective filtering of opportunities. 
I only shared the spider component of the code 

This code is no longer fonctionnal : 

• The website has been modified so I would need to adjust the url 

• I was developing the code to make it less request intensive
